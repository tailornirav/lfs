Based on LFS and BLFS. These are my OS scripts. To install LINUX for AMD 3400G.

-> Basic LFS with XFS instead of EXT4.
-> Tests aren't included.
-> Top level applications -- Firefox, Neomutt, Neovim, FFMPEG, Pulseaudio.
-> Need someone for sanity check and reducing the bloat. Any kind of help is appreciated.
